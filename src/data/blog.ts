    title: 'What Really Counts!',
    excerpt: 'A powerful encounter with Mr. Rhein, a 79-year-old former Penn State athlete, reveals the most important lesson about what truly matters in life. Sometimes wisdom comes from the most unexpected places.',
    content: 'His eyes filled with tears as he lay across his bed, his left leg dangling over the edge. Mr. Rhein possessed the mind of a 20-year-old, but it was trapped in his 79-year-old body. He was fed up with his inability to do what came naturally when he was young. Even wearing his favorite warm-up suit – the one with the Penn State insignia blazoned across the front – failed to cheer him. I asked him if Penn State was his alma mater.\n\n"Yes," he said thoughtfully. "I graduated in \'38. Those were the good old days, when I could do no wrong. We were the best. I played basketball and baseball. We were champions in everything we did." He looked away and stated quietly, "I played ball my entire life: handball, tennis, basketball. They consumed my time until this arthritis got the best of me. Now I can\'t do anything without my walker."\n\nMr. Rhein seemed to sense that he was at the end of his life. Reflection engulfed his thoughts. It seemed appropriate to ask him something that would draw him out. "Mr. Rhein," I queried, "as you think back on your life and the insights you\'ve gained, what do you believe to be the most important thing in life?" Without hesitation he replied, "Family. It\'s family." Almost as if he were a crusader, he lifted his head and emphasized, "Don\'t act like a jerk, keep your family. If you lose them, you\'ve lost everything." He dropped his head back and looked away.\n\nDuring my lunch hour, I found a private place to think. Sitting on a bench in the old surgical theater the hospital now keeps as a museum, I reflected on Mr. Rhein\'s words. They made me think of Jeremy Taylor, the 17th century theologian who wrote, "The sublimity of wisdom is to do those things living which are desired when dying."\n\nThe hard work associated with my job, continuing education, volunteer work, athletic involvement, and general activities of daily living consumed my days. The question to be considered was, "Am I making the wisest use of my time?" At the end of my life, will the time I spent gathering extra income from overtime or the effort placed on maintaining a fastidious home seem as important as playing basketball in the driveway with my son, or reading stories and playing doll house with my daughter? The answer seemed obvious. "Thanks Mr. Rhein," I whispered aloud. "You made my day, and maybe my life."',

    title: 'Smart Food Shopping: 12 Practical Tips to Cut Your Grocery Bill',
    excerpt: 'A community health nurse asks for practical advice to help families struggling financially. These timeless money-saving strategies can help any household reduce food expenses without sacrificing nutrition.',
    content: '**Q.** As a new RN working in community health, I spend much of my time with a family struggling to make ends meet. It would be nice to sit down and talk through some money-saving tips with them, but I\'m not sure what to include. What are some basic guidelines I can use next time to help families reduce their food bills?\n\n**A.** Every family has different lifestyles and eating patterns, but there are certain principles that most everyone can use:\n\n1. Prepare a shopping list. This list should be based on the meals you plan to prepare during the coming week. Start the list at the beginning of the week and you will be able to add other items as supplies become low.\n\n2. Don\'t buy anything on impulse. Stick to your list. What appears to be a good bargain is not really a good investment if you don\'t need it.\n\n3. Avoid buying when hungry. Low blood sugar and a growling tummy can greatly influence the type and quantity of your purchases.\n\n4. Evaluate where to buy non-grocery items. Drugs, toiletries, cleaning solutions, and school supplies are typically more expensive at grocery stores than at discount drug and department stores.\n\n5. Shop advertised specials.\n\n6. Use coupons to your advantage. Use them for items you were already going to purchase at stores conveniently located near you. Resist the temptation to drive all over town to save a few cents on specials and coupons.\n\n7. Shop discount membership warehouses. The price is generally reduced at such stores if you are willing to buy in bulk.\n\n8. Consider generic brands. Name brands are not always superior in quality and except for special sales, their price is always higher.\n\n9. Use extreme caution when considering prepared meals. Their convenience is tempting, but the price per serving can be considerably higher.\n\n10. Avoid fast-food. Eating out is costly and can be devastating to an already fragile budget.\n\n11. Evaluate the foods your family chooses to eat. For example try drinking water instead of soda, purchase vegetables instead of chips and substitute popcorn or cereal for expensive treats before bedtime. This will reduce your bill and improve your health.\n\n12. Talk with your friends about suggestions they may have for saving on their food bills. You may be pleasantly surprised at the insights they reveal.',

    title: 'The New Graduate\'s Guide to Financial Planning: How Much Should I Save?',
    excerpt: 'A newly graduated RN wants to save for a home, children\'s education, and retirement but doesn\'t know how much to set aside monthly. Learn the simple formula to calculate exactly what you need to reach your financial goals.',
    content: '**Q.** I am a newly graduated, single RN. This is my first job, and I want to spend my money wisely. Primarily, I\'d like to begin saving for a home, my children\'s college education, and retirement. I plan to make monthly installments in an investment plan available through work. I\'m not sure how much to set aside each month to reach my financial goals. What guidelines do you have to help me decide how much to save?\n\n**A.** Written goals are essential for reaching your financial objectives. Once this has been established, the process of determining how much to set aside each month and the number of years involved is actually very simple. The chart is designed to help you establish realistic targets toward which to aim. This is how it works.\n\nImagine that in 20 years you will need $100,000 for your child\'s education. You have learned that the mutual fund in which you plan to invest has an overall return of 8% during the past 10 years. Based upon this knowledge you want to know how much to invest each year at 8% interest in order to achieve your goal.\n\nFirst, run your finger down the year column to the year 20. Then move it over to the 8% column where you will find the number 45.762. Divide the number into $100,000 to learn the amount you need to invest annually in order to meet your objective. In this case $100,000 divided by 45.762 equals $2,185.22. This means by investing $2,185.22 each year over a 20-year period you will have the $100,000 needed. Divided by 12, this is $182.10 per month.\n\nFollowing this formula, you will know exactly how much to put away each year in order to meet your financial goals.',

    title: 'Credit Card Consolidation: A Smart Strategy or Dangerous Trap?',
    excerpt: 'With six maxed-out credit cards, should you take an 8% consolidation loan? Learn why changing spending habits matters more than just switching debt around, and get practical strategies to break free from credit addiction.',
    content: '**Q.** My credit cards are out of control. I have six cards and each one is stretched to the limit. An opportunity has arisen in which I can take out a single loan at 8% and pay them all off. What do you think?\n\n**A.** On the surface, it sounds like a good idea. Interest on most credit cards, except for introductory offers, run 24% or more. You should be able to save a great deal of money in interest fees if you pay off your creditors now. You should, however, consider carefully the cause of your debt dilemma before you consolidate your bills or take on additional debt.\n\nBe committed to changing your spending patterns. If not, you will find yourself with an extended credit line. Then you will not only have your newly accrued credit card bill, but the 8% loan.\n\nBased on your history, a new attitude toward credit cards is in order. Consider the use of credit cards to be a privilege, not a right. Many people find it helpful to live credit card free for three months or more. This gives them a chance to overcome their addiction and recapture healthy habits. Lock your credit cards in a safety deposit box or give them to a friend to put in a safe place – anything to make it difficult for you to get access to them. At first, it may seem hard, but you can survive without your cards. If you\'re like most people you\'ll find that you spend less when you use cash instead of credit.\n\nOnce your hiatus is over, make a simple promise to yourself: Always pay the full amount when your credit bill comes due. If you don\'t pay the full amount, don\'t use the card until it is. This simple rule can help keep you out of debt.',

    excerpt: 'How can a family save for vacation without drastically cutting their standard of living? Discover the art of finding balance between Ebenezer Scrooge-level frugality and thoughtful expense reduction that actually works.',
    content: '**Q.** My family and I have been discussing how to save for our vacation. One thought was that we should reduce our expenses and put that money aside for our trip. I asked some of the people with whom I work for suggestions. Their ideas included bringing lunch to work instead of buying it, washing my own car instead of going to the car wash, and drinking regular coffee instead of going to the coffee shop. What other suggestions do you have to help us decrease our living expenses without infringing too much on our standard of living?\n\n**A.** The process of evaluating expenses and deciding where to spend your money is a good exercise. In fact it should be done on an annual basis because new expenses tend to creep in and eat up cash. Learning where to cut back without hurting your lifestyle is like finding money you never knew you had.\n\nThis newly found money can then be designated to other areas that are more important to you. Saving a little bit of money each day can grow into a great deal by the end of the year. Add it up: Simple math dictates that if you save just $5.00 each day, you\'ll have $1,825 by year\'s end.\n\nOf course, chopping firewood for your pot belly stove and eating a breakfast of dry bread and powdered milk is not for everyone. Ebenezer Scrooge taught us that quality of life is more important than large quantities of money in the bank. The trick is to find a balance between lavishness and austerity that works for you.\n\nProvided below are several pages of ideas for cutting back that participants in my financial seminars have submitted. Forms are also provided to help you list ideas and to calculate the amount you will save. Have fun!',

    title: 'From Red to Black: A Four-Step Plan to Eliminate Debt and Build Wealth',
    excerpt: 'A newly promoted head nurse with a substantial raise wants to break the debt cycle. Learn the four fundamental steps that lead from financial indebtedness to investment and wealth building.',
    content: '**Q.** Recently, I became head nurse of a medical-surgical unit in a large teaching hospital. Along with the promotion and new responsibilities, I received a hefty raise. It seems I am always in debt and this may be a good time to make changes in my spending pattern. What are some steps I can take to get out of the red into the black financially?\n\n**A.** You are not alone. In fact, the average American family devotes about 25% of its spendable income to outstanding debts. There are several basic steps that when followed, will free you from financial indebtedness and allow you to invest in the future.\n\nThe first step is to live within your income. This involves establishing a realistic budget – the foundation for fiscal fitness. Without limits, it\'s difficult to control the flow of finances. You must then make spending decisions that allow you to honor your budget.\n\nThe second step is to establish a plan to pay off current debts. Prepare a list of your debtors and the amount owed to each. In separate columns, write down the total amount owed, the monthly payment for each one, and the length of time it will take to pay off each one. Now you have a realistic picture of your financial situation and the timeline necessary to take care of your obligations. If possible, take steps to pay off the principle in advance. This will reduce the amount of interest paid and free funds for use in lowering the principles of other debts.\n\nThe third step is to borrow from yourself. Instead of going to a bank or using your charge card to borrow more money, establish a savings account that equals at least three months of living expenses. With this as a base, you will have a source from which to draw money to pay for unexpected bills. Cash for a broken refrigerator, a ruined tire, or a new roof will be readily available. In essence, you become your own banker. Additional funds can be put aside for specific purchases, such as a new car, a lawn mower, a vacation, and holiday gifts. Include savings as part of your monthly budget now, even though you\'re still paying outstanding debts. This will establish a small reserve from which to draw for emergencies and a healthy pattern for the future.\n\nFinally, once you have established a cash reserve, money can be invested for the future. Retirement, a new home and college education are three common areas for which people invest.\n\nGetting out of debt and staying out of debt takes discipline and hard work. The person committed to following these four steps will experience the peace of mind and financial freedom provided by gaining financial control.',

    excerpt: '"I get paid on Friday and by Monday I\'m out of cash." Sound familiar? Discover a simple tracking method that can reduce impulse spending by 30% and reveal where your money really goes.',
    content: '**Q.** During lunch the other day the subject of budgets came up. One of my colleagues said she isn\'t sure where all her money goes. She gets paid on Friday and by Monday she\'s out of cash. She\'s obviously spending more for "out of pocket" items than she realizes. What suggestions do you have to help her control this?\n\n**A.** The Case of the Missing Cash is not an uncommon caper. A cash flow record can reveal where your money was spent and help reduce cash flow. This record consists of a sheet of paper divided into three sections. On the left side is a column for writing the date of each cash purchase. The middle section is for indicating the items purchased, and the column on the right is for listing the amount. Use this form for every purchase made during a 60-day period. Out-of-pocket cash spent for a quick gallon of milk on the way home from work, a magazine at the newsstand, and lunch out can then be duly recorded in your budget.\n\nMost people are amazed at what they find. The amount of compulsive spending at fast food restaurants, clothing stores, or hardware centers can add up to significant dollars. With this information in hand, you can adjust your budget to reflect what is actually spent. Many people also find the exercise of writing down purchases makes them consider more carefully the necessity of each one. Typically, this results in a drop of 30% in cash purchases.\n\nThe cash flow record has helped many people gain control over their cash expenses. Some find it helpful as a permanent companion. Others pull it from their files for an annual 60-day check.',

    excerpt: 'Your employer offers a 403(b) plan with multiple fund options, but how do you choose? Learn the essential guidelines for selecting mutual funds that match your risk tolerance, time horizon, and retirement goals.',
    content: '**Q.** My employer provides employees the option of investing in a 403(b) plan. This looks like a wonderful way to save for retirement since taxes are not taken out until after retirement. Most employees have decided to participate in this program, but we are not sure which fund to choose. What are some guidelines we can use in making this decision?\n\n**A.** The needs for each individual and family are different and depend upon their financial objectives. There are however some universal principles that are helpful:\n\n1. Secure a list of the mutual funds available through your employer that specialize in long-term growth and examine their track records. Such information is readily available online. Examine the rates of return during the past one, three, five and ten years. Past performance will, of course, not guarantee future performance. It will, however, provide a logical base of knowledge upon which to build.\n\n2. Consider carefully the risk factors involved with each fund. The greater the risk, the greater the potential for higher return. The amount of risk you are willing to take will depend upon your temperament and the amount of time over which you plan to invest. Some people are comfortable taking risks while others need the security of a sure thing. A fund that specializes in speculative stocks will fit the former. A fund that invests in secured bonds and treasury notes will be closer for the latter. Time is also part of the question. The person anticipating retirement in 30 years will have greater opportunities to recover from a poor return or loss than someone retiring in just five years.\n\n3. Diversification is an important consideration for any plan. It\'s smart to place your money in a variety of areas. This way, when one type of investment does poorly, others can compensate for the loss. There are several ways in which this can be done.\n\nYou may consider a single fund that invests in a variety of areas. These may include a combination of stocks from giant stable companies (Blue Chip), stocks that have opportunity for quick increase or decrease in value (speculative), company loans (bonds), loans from the US government (treasury notes), property (real estate), local or USA-based companies (domestic), companies outside the USA (foreign), and companies that specialize in a specific industry, such as healthcare, software, or utilities.\n\nYou may also choose to place money in several different funds that specialize in one of the areas listed above. This provides the diversification you desire as well as the expertise of several mutual management teams.\n\n4. The variety of fees charged are as diverse as the funds themselves. Some charge a fee when funds are purchased or sold, others have fees that decline the longer you keep your money invested with them, and others, called no-load funds, charge only a yearly maintenance fee. When such fees are compared their past and expected rate of return should be considered.\n\nDetailed information regarding the mutual companies in which you are interested can be found online. Read the information you secure carefully including the prospectus.',

    title: 'The ABCs of Leadership',
    excerpt: 'What does it take to achieve the highest effectiveness as a leader? Discover the essential traits that repeatedly appear in successful leaders: Inner Qualities, Attitude, Communication Skills, and Goal Orientation.',
    content: 'Some people seem to achieve a level of excellence in whatever they pursue. They stand out as leaders regardless of their specialty. A colleague and I recently discussed the dynamics of this phenomenon. We asked, "What does it take to achieve the highest effectiveness as a leader?" After pouring over mounds of research material, it became apparent that certain traits repeatedly appear: Inner Qualities, Attitude, Communication Skills and Goal Orientation.\n\n## Inner Qualities\n\n**A**lways be conscious that true leadership must be earned. Sure you may be given a position of authority, but the respect associated with that position must be maintained through wise decisions and honorable actions. Consider the manager who speaks softly and thoughtfully and makes wise decisions. Response to the individual\'s authority and directives will be much more positive than to the director who talks down to staff and reprimands them in front of others.\n\n**B**e aware that integrity is the framework upon which earned leadership is built. People need to believe your motives are pure. They should feel that they can count on you to keep your word and to look out for the best interest of both individuals and the group. To support this confidence, the decisions left to your discretion and the actions you take should reflect the highest principles.\n\n**C**onsider the importance of modest self-confidence. This is something that comes from within and is developed over time. It reflects self-respect as well as respect for others. People appreciate the demeanor projected by someone with the confidence to jump in and take action but few want to follow the proud and arrogant. Individuals with modest self-assurance are able to state an opinion or give supervision without the necessity of trying to please everyone all the time.\n\n**D**evelop the ability to recognize your weaknesses and strengths. People who know and accept who they are possess information that will assist them in making informed decisions. They are better able to understand what they should do themselves, and what to delegate to others, and the process of decision making that works best for them.\n\n**E**xcel by concentrating on your strengths. Focus on what you do best. Use your strengths to compensate for your weaknesses. If you have strong interests in a given area, develop them. If interaction with people or administration is your forte, concentrate on those areas. It is easier to fine-tune areas of interest than to cultivate territory that has little appeal to you.\n\n**F**orm a passion to learn. Find out all you can about the world in which you live. Knowledge is an essential ingredient in making wise decisions. Seek out information that will enable you to make the best possible decisions and perform tasks to the best of your ability.\n\n**G**ain wisdom from every situation. Since wisdom is a blend of knowledge, experience, and understanding, the wise person generally has good judgment and the ability to see behind the obvious. Although everyone possesses the potential for wisdom, it is developed over time and requires special attention if it is to grow. The results are of immeasurable value.\n\n**H**old a balance between your physical, intellectual, social, spiritual, and professional needs. Well-rounded people have a broad integrated perspective of life. This enables them to make decisions based on a healthy balance of knowledge.\n\n## Attitude\n\n**I**nstigate a climate in which the right attitude is always taken. Attitude determines much of what people achieve in life. Optimistic, enthusiastic people who have a good sense of humor and a vision for what can be accomplished tend to be achievers.\n\n**J**ust as you desire to be liked, demonstrate a genuine love for others. The president of a large and rapidly growing sales organization was asked the reason for the continued growth of his business. He responded that such growth comes when managers and sales people genuinely love their people. While it is important to know how to approach people when working with them, many problems can be averted if you are genuine and people recognize your motives as pure.\n\n**K**eep the desire to serve the people with whom you work and the customers for whom you are responsible. Giving of yourself to benefit others has been called the secret to personal happiness. It is much more rewarding than demanding actions from others. Don\'t spend your time reprimanding staff and demanding that they do more. Care about them personally and do all you can to encourage their development.\n\n**L**earn to be a team player. Support the projects and aspirations of others. Be a cheerleader for the organization, its members, and their projects. The enthusiasm associated with such support is contagious, since people tend to gravitate toward positive action.\n\n**M**aintain an appropriate sense of loyalty to others. Others should feel confident that your effort will always be in the best interest of the organization and those with whom you work. They should understand that you are committed to fulfilling the goals and tasks to which you are assigned. In turn, your customers and those you supervise should see you as someone who will look out for their best interests through even the most difficult of circumstances.\n\n**N**ever forget the importance of empathy. Try to look at things from other people\'s perspective and understand their feelings and motivations. For example, make disciplinary actions in a way that will benefit the employees\' development and allow them to retain their dignity. Reprimand in private; focus on the individuals\' behaviors – not on their personal character. Time should also be allotted for them to explain their perspective. You can then work with them toward a reasonable solution that will benefit their future actions and the organization in general.\n\n**O**btain an understanding of the part you are to play as each situation unfolds. Recognize that your role is different when someone else is running the program than when you are in charge. A wise leader can provide support to others as well as take charge. This spirit of flexibility can help others develop their management skills.\n\n## Communication Skills\n\n**P**lace premiere importance on developing your communication skills. Effective communication skills are essential if you are to convey your ideas so others can understand and accept them.\n\n*Learn to write down your ideas in simple, easy-to-understand sentences.* Good grammar, error-free notes, memos, and reports that are well documented and to the point command respect.\n\n*Become a conversationalist.* Direct dialogue between two or more individuals involves the ability to deliver information in a way that is well received. Develop the ability to look others in the eye, to state your ideas clearly and to use language and illustrations to which they will respond.\n\n*Be conscious of nonverbal messages.* This includes hair and clothing style, posture, facial expression, and the frequency of eye contact. Observe the way people in leadership positions conduct themselves and learn their moves. Stand erect, speak with confidence, and wear clean clothes appropriate to the situation.\n\n*Learn to listen.* Listening provides the opportunity to know people and understand the most amicable approaches for decision making and problem solving. Simple questions such as "What do you think?" or "What ideas do you have?" the generic "How is it going?" help draw people into conversation and provide a format for gaining knowledge. Try to talk 20% of the time and listen 80%.\n\n*Get comfortable speaking in front of others.* Look for opportunities to make public presentations, especially if they are difficult for you. This may involve anything from small group meetings to formal presentations in front of large groups. Practice will help you fine-tune your speaking and presentation skills for the future.\n\n**Q**uestions that are important to others deserve an answer. Being "in the know" has been described as a primary key to motivation. Many rumors and feelings of discontent emerge because of a lack of knowledge. People need to understand the rationale behind the decisions that are made. They may not agree with every decision that is made, but it will help them feel part of the overall program and willing to make the extra effort necessary to ensure its success.\n\n**R**emember to learn the culture and live by it. Determine the best you can the customs and habits of the people with whom you are working. Are people serious and impersonal, or are they informal and jovial? Observe too, their dress and general areas of interest. A cowboy hat may fit in well in Texas but be out of place in Boston. Actions and dress establish an unspoken message they will draw people to you or turn them away.\n\n**S**tudy the individuals with whom you work and learn how to deal most effectively with each one. Each person you supervise needs a different level of accountability. Some function best with a great deal of autonomy while others desire direction. Treat each one with the balance of structure and freedom needed for optimal performance.\n\n**T**ake the time to share the glory. Healthy affirmation can help people feel good about their accomplishment and spur them to continue in their efforts. When someone does a particularly good job or enlists the courage to do something new, let the person know you\'re aware of the accomplishment. When possible, do so in public. Of course, it\'s essential that you be sincere; false platitudes are easily recognized and can do the opposite of what you intended.\n\n**U**nderstand the dynamics involved in problem solving. Gain the ability to see the problem, arrive at solutions, and implement these remedies in a timely manner. Try to see the big picture while considering the details. Seek input from a variety of sources, including the people affected by the decision. Intuition, which is an internal feeling that comes from a strong base of knowledge, should be factored into the equation. Recognize that sometimes there is no best solution. Be willing to compromise. And consider the feelings of others when announcing conclusions.\n\n## Goal Orientation\n\n**V**ision is the ability to conceive a perspective of what can be accomplished. Benjamin Franklin was known for his ability to see possibilities and to set things right. The result was many inventions and the formation of numerous institutions, including America\'s first hospital. Of course, a vision without goals is just an idea. Some of the most talented are also the most unsuccessful simply because they have not established guidelines to harness their abilities. Leaders need to see possibilities, set specific goals, prioritize, and then work tenaciously if they wish to see their vision come to reality.\n\n*Goals establish activities that are measurable by time and action.* Goals should be written so it is possible to see what is accomplished and when. They provide the structure for determining the timing and effort needed to see a vision blossom into reality.\n\n*Priorities should be set so time is spent doing what is most important in order to reach your objective.* Before each day begins, set a structure for the activities that need to be accomplished. Be smart. Work smart. Your intent should be to focus on meaningful accomplishments and not on meaningless activity.\n\n*Always complete what you start.* People should be able to count on you to finish any job you are given or personal goal you set. If complications set in, let the people involved know so they can work with you to solve the problem.\n\n*Weight should be placed on finding someone in whom you can confide to help you reach your goals.* Everyone needs a confidant to turn to for advice. Find someone who will listen to you and help guide your thought. A wise friend who is concerned about your development and success can provide invaluable insights.\n\n**X**amine the importance of taking your responsibilities seriously. Own your job. Do every task with the same commitment you would give if it were for your personal business.\n\n**Y**ou must take responsibility for your career. Take the initiative. Be a doer – a person of action with the reputation of getting things accomplished. Volunteer to get things done. Take control of your career or it will stagnate.\n\n**Z**ealously seek excellence. The caliber of your work should reflect a desire for excellence. You\'ll lack the dexterity and skill of a seasoned veteran the first time you attempt something. But the end product should always reflect your best efforts. Know the difference between those things that require perfection and those things that don\'t. The person who requires flawlessness in everything will have time to accomplish little. Wisdom is needed to determine the level of perfection right for the occasion.\n\nLeaders should find the intrigue of developing qualities of leadership to be never ending and immeasurably rewarding.',

    title: 'The ABCs of Building Good Working Relationships',
    excerpt: 'Working relationships can be challenging and significantly impact the work environment and productivity. Discover practical A-Z strategies to build healthy working relationships in any work setting.',
    content: 'Working relationships can be challenging and impact significantly the work environment and level of productivity. The following are a set of hints to help build healthy working relationships regardless of the work setting.\n\n**A**cknowledge *that some conflicts are inevitable.* Differences in personalities, the stress of work, multiple responsibilities, tension at home, irritable coworkers, insecurities, even fatigue from the normal pressures of life can contribute to misunderstandings. Recognize that these difficulties exist and work to minimize their influence on your working relationships.\n\n**B**e careful *to create an environment that averts potential problems.* Start off meetings with clients and colleagues by establishing a rapport that says, "We are in this thing together." Show yourself to be an advocate rather than an adversary during your first few minutes together. After the customary introductions ask how things are going and address concerns in a timely manner.\n\n**C**ommunication *takes many forms.* Verbal and nonverbal communication – facial expressions, tone of voice, stance, and general demeanor each give a monumental message. Take a quick inventory of the message you convey. Do you project concern for the other person\'s needs? A warm smile can be one of your best assets. Give others your full attention.\n\n**D**etermine *that each meeting will be a learning experience.* By its very nature business meetings are an exploration into the unknown. Variables arise and as a result no business project is perfect. Recognize this and look for opportunities to problem solve and fine-tune together. The team approach helps usurp an adversarial relationship.\n\n**E**stablish *a healthy atmosphere by projecting a positive mental attitude.* Sure, you may feel overwhelmed by your assignment, angry your boss left you extra work or frustrated by a nagging headache, but these are of little interest to others. They are looking for a demeanor which conveys trustworthiness. A smile, a word of affirmation, and a focus on constructive issues will help them place their attention on the positive aspects of work.\n\n**F**ormulate *an alliance with others.* Get on their side and help them find answers to their concerns. Once they have expressed their needs, work with them to find viable outcomes. Acknowledge your understanding of each problem expressed (even if you do not agree that they are valid). You can then move on to find solutions.\n\n**G**ive careful thought *to the possible reasons behind complaints.* The real issue may not be what is initially conveyed. Unreasonable demands may be due to a number of things. A person may feel isolated, fearful of the unknown, overwhelmed by the challenges of their job or resentful that they have little corporate support. We are not expected to resolve all the emotional or professional hurdles of others but we should be aware such problems exist and provide an environment of support for them.\n\n**H**elp *our colleagues save face.* Frequently a rude comment or unnecessary criticism is a cry of frustration. Once the crisis is over, be able to forgive and forget. No one needs to "win" or "lose." The focus should be on building a healthy work environment.\n\n**I**nitiate *problem-solving techniques.* Simple methods such as helping to identify problems, compiling a list of possible solutions, and selecting the best plan of action will put you in alliance with others. People with numerous questions or unsolved issues often find making a list of questions helpful. They can then determine who to ask and when your questions will be addressed.\n\n**J**ustifying *your actions or those of others is not necessary.* Defensiveness is divisive. Focus on listening and problem solving. Who is right is generally of little importance. The person who listens 85% of the time and talks 15% is in a position to sum up stated needs and help others talk through possible solutions. Primary importance should be on what can be done now to ensure that issues are resolved.\n\n**K**now *it\'s the situation, not you that others are attacking.* Your job is to provide the level of productivity you know is appropriate in a congenial and supportive way. If others are rude, demanding or have multiple complaints, don\'t take it personally. Assume they are dealing with tough personal issues and their actions are an expression of frustration. Chances are you are not the only one being treated this way.\n\n**L**et others know *you are sorry for difficulties that occur.* Don\'t be afraid to sympathize with them over an inconvenience or unhappy incident even if it is beyond your control. The poorly designed software for your project will leave many unanswered questions. Acknowledge this weakness and work together to find solutions.\n\n**M**ake every effort *to let others know the reasons for what you are doing.* People respond favorably when they understand the purpose and plan for a procedure. Explaining the rationale for required procedures or processes will help overcome objections and cause people to be more cooperative, compliant and content.\n\n**N**ever blame others *regardless of who\'s at fault.* It may be appropriate to sympathize over a difficult situation but never place blame. You do not have all of the facts and what you say may come back to haunt you. Comments tend to become exaggerated as they are passed along.\n\n**O**bserve *the principles of Transactional Analysis.* This system of explaining interpersonal communication teaches that people talk and act in one of three ways; as if they are adults, children or parents. It is not unusual for someone who is upset to act like a child, complaining and whining. The professional who takes the role of an adult will respond to them in an objective manner and not fall prey to childish manipulation. In the same way one who plays the role of parent, dictating orders to others, will not be able to intimidate the restrained, mature adult. Understanding the roles people play can be helpful in providing the emotional support they need.\n\n**P**eople respond well *to those who are genuinely concerned.* Most potential conflicts dissolve when people understand that someone sincerely cares about them. Concern must be authentic and expressed through your general disposition. When you see a co-worker ask yourself, "How would I treat them if they were a friend in this situation?"\n\n**Q**uietly project *a demeanor that colleagues are equals.* The person who takes a condescending attitude or who is overly defensive does little to foster the spirit of cooperation. Mutual respect is essential for building an effective working partnership.\n\n**R**emain in control *of your emotions.* Any sign of anger or teary emotion removes your image of being a competent, objective professional. Give others the security of knowing you will remain strong and confident even during the most difficult of circumstances.\n\n**S**ome people *are just plain contentious.* There is nothing you can do to help them. Recognize this and don\'t be threatened by it. Do your best to make them comfortable but don\'t feel guilty if you are unable to resolve a lifetime of pugnacity.\n\n**T**ake time *to do the "little extra" things.* Find answers to questions in a timely manner and provide both a verbal and written response. Make sure visitors to the office have sufficient and comfortable work space, and that there is plenty of coffee on hand during meetings. Small thoughtful gestures can greatly influence the overall climate of the work environment.\n\n**U**nderstand *the importance of humor.* The intensity of an otherwise difficult situation can be lessened by a moment of laughter. Enjoy each person for the unique qualities they possess.\n\n**V**ery few problems *are without solutions.* Not every problem can be resolved immediately but you can start by identifying problems, noting possible outcomes, and determining procedures or people who can bring resolution. This is 90% of the work. You can then follow up on areas that require additional attention.\n\n**W**hen possible, *guide others to reasonable solutions.* People often have mixed feelings or draw inaccurate conclusions about a situation. Ask questions and make frequent summary statements that will lead them to a logical and workable conclusion.\n\n**X**-plore *the insights of others.* Talk with people in your office, read books and peruse articles from a variety of sources. Look for ideas and approaches for dealing with unusual situations. Fresh perspectives can provide a new approach you might not have otherwise considered.\n\n**Y**ou are the key *to effective problem solving.* People will generally live up to your expectations. People have an uncanny ability to respond to both our conscious and unconscious comments and actions. If you assume most people want to be logical, cooperative and mature they will try their best to live up to your expectations. If you presume most people are negative, full of complaints and demanding, you can anticipate that most people will be this way as well.\n\n**Z**ero in *on specific needs.* This is after all, why you are here. It is easy to become so busy completing tasks that you forget about the individual concerns of the people with whom you are working. Determining present and potential areas of need and how to deal with them should be an automatic part of your plan.\n\nBuilding good working relationships is not always easy. It is an art that requires constant fine tuning and practice. The insights listed above are designed as tools to help you be more effective in dealing with even the most difficult situations.',
