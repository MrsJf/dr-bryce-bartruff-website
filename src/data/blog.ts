    title: 'What Really Counts!',
    excerpt: 'A powerful encounter with Mr. Rhein, a 79-year-old former Penn State athlete, reveals the most important lesson about what truly matters in life. Sometimes wisdom comes from the most unexpected places.',
    content: 'His eyes filled with tears as he lay across his bed, his left leg dangling over the edge. Mr. Rhein possessed the mind of a 20-year-old, but it was trapped in his 79-year-old body. He was fed up with his inability to do what came naturally when he was young. Even wearing his favorite warm-up suit – the one with the Penn State insignia blazoned across the front – failed to cheer him. I asked him if Penn State was his alma mater.\n\n"Yes," he said thoughtfully. "I graduated in \'38. Those were the good old days, when I could do no wrong. We were the best. I played basketball and baseball. We were champions in everything we did." He looked away and stated quietly, "I played ball my entire life: handball, tennis, basketball. They consumed my time until this arthritis got the best of me. Now I can\'t do anything without my walker."\n\nMr. Rhein seemed to sense that he was at the end of his life. Reflection engulfed his thoughts. It seemed appropriate to ask him something that would draw him out. "Mr. Rhein," I queried, "as you think back on your life and the insights you\'ve gained, what do you believe to be the most important thing in life?" Without hesitation he replied, "Family. It\'s family."\n\nAlmost as if he were a crusader, he lifted his head and emphasized, "Don\'t act like a jerk, keep your family. If you lose them, you\'ve lost everything." He dropped his head back and looked away.\n\nDuring my lunch hour, I found a private place to think. Sitting on a bench in the old surgical theater the hospital now keeps as a museum, I reflected on Mr. Rhein\'s words. They made me think of Jeremy Taylor, the 17th century theologian who wrote, "The sublimity of wisdom is to do those things living which are desired when dying."\n\nThe hard work associated with my job, continuing education, volunteer work, athletic involvement, and general activities of daily living consumed my days. The question to be considered was, "Am I making the wisest use of my time?" At the end of my life, will the time I spent gathering extra income from overtime or the effort placed on maintaining a fastidious home seem as important as playing basketball in the driveway with my son, or reading stories and playing doll house with my daughter? The answer seemed obvious. "Thanks Mr. Rhein," I whispered aloud. "You made my day, and maybe my life."',

    title: 'Smart Food Shopping: 12 Practical Tips to Cut Your Grocery Bill',
    excerpt: 'A community health nurse asks for practical advice to help families struggling financially. These timeless money-saving strategies can help any household reduce food expenses without sacrificing nutrition.',
    content: 'Q: As a new RN working in community health, I spend much of my time with a family struggling to make ends meet. It would be nice to sit down and talk through some money-saving tips with them, but I\'m not sure what to include. What are some basic guidelines I can use next time to help families reduce their food bills?\n\nA: Every family has different lifestyles and eating patterns, but there are certain principles that most everyone can use:\n\n1. Prepare a shopping list. This list should be based on the meals you plan to prepare during the coming week. Start the list at the beginning of the week and you will be able to add other items as supplies become low.\n\n2. Don\'t buy anything on impulse. Stick to your list. What appears to be a good bargain is not really a good investment if you don\'t need it.\n\n3. Avoid buying when hungry. Low blood sugar and a growling tummy can greatly influence the type and quantity of your purchases.\n\n4. Evaluate where to buy non-grocery items. Drugs, toiletries, cleaning solutions, and school supplies are typically more expensive at grocery stores than at discount drug and department stores.\n\n5. Shop advertised specials.\n\n6. Use coupons to your advantage. Use them for items you were already going to purchase at stores conveniently located near you. Resist the temptation to drive all over town to save a few cents on specials and coupons.\n\n7. Shop discount membership warehouses. The price is generally reduced at such stores if you are willing to buy in bulk.\n\n8. Consider generic brands. Name brands are not always superior in quality and except for special sales, their price is always higher.\n\n9. Use extreme caution when considering prepared meals. Their convenience is tempting, but the price per serving can be considerably higher.\n\n10. Avoid fast-food. Eating out is costly and can be devastating to an already fragile budget.\n\n11. Evaluate the foods your family chooses to eat. For example try drinking water instead of soda, purchase vegetables instead of chips and substitute popcorn or cereal for expensive treats before bedtime. This will reduce your bill and improve your health.\n\n12. Talk with your friends about suggestions they may have for saving on their food bills. You may be pleasantly surprised at the insights they reveal.',

    title: 'The New Graduate\'s Guide to Financial Planning: How Much Should I Save?',
    excerpt: 'A newly graduated RN wants to save for a home, children\'s education, and retirement but doesn\'t know how much to set aside monthly. Learn the simple formula to calculate exactly what you need to reach your financial goals.',
    content: 'Q: I am a newly graduated, single RN. This is my first job, and I want to spend my money wisely. Primarily, I\'d like to begin saving for a home, my children\'s college education, and retirement. I plan to make monthly installments in an investment plan available through work. I\'m not sure how much to set aside each month to reach my financial goals. What guidelines do you have to help me decide how much to save?\n\nA: Written goals are essential for reaching your financial objectives. Once this has been established, the process of determining how much to set aside each month and the number of years involved is actually very simple. The chart is designed to help you establish realistic targets toward which to aim. This is how it works.\n\nImagine that in 20 years you will need $100,000 for your child\'s education. You have learned that the mutual fund in which you plan to invest has an overall return of 8% during the past 10 years. Based upon this knowledge you want to know how much to invest each year at 8% interest in order to achieve your goal.\n\nFirst, run your finger down the year column to the year 20. Then move it over to the 8% column where you will find the number 45.762. Divide the number into $100,000 to learn the amount you need to invest annually in order to meet your objective. In this case $100,000 divided by 45.762 equals $2,185.22. This means by investing $2,185.22 each year over a 20-year period you will have the $100,000 needed. Divided by 12, this is $182.10 per month.\n\nFollowing this formula, you will know exactly how much to put away each year in order to meet your financial goals.',

    title: 'Credit Card Consolidation: A Smart Strategy or Dangerous Trap?',
    excerpt: 'With six maxed-out credit cards, should you take an 8% consolidation loan? Learn why changing spending habits matters more than just switching debt around, and get practical strategies to break free from credit addiction.',
    content: 'Q: My credit cards are out of control. I have six cards and each one is stretched to the limit. An opportunity has arisen in which I can take out a single loan at 8% and pay them all off. What do you think?\n\nA: On the surface, it sounds like a good idea. Interest on most credit cards, except for introductory offers, run 24% or more. You should be able to save a great deal of money in interest fees if you pay off your creditors now. You should, however, consider carefully the cause of your debt dilemma before you consolidate your bills or take on additional debt.\n\nBe committed to changing your spending patterns. If not, you will find yourself with an extended credit line. Then you will not only have your newly accrued credit card bill, but the 8% loan.\n\nBased on your history, a new attitude toward credit cards is in order. Consider the use of credit cards to be a privilege, not a right. Many people find it helpful to live credit card free for three months or more. This gives them a chance to overcome their addiction and recapture healthy habits. Lock your credit cards in a safety deposit box or give them to a friend to put in a safe place – anything to make it difficult for you to get access to them. At first, it may seem hard, but you can survive without your cards. If you\'re like most people you\'ll find that you spend less when you use cash instead of credit.\n\nOnce your hiatus is over, make a simple promise to yourself: Always pay the full amount when your credit bill comes due. If you don\'t pay the full amount, don\'t use the card until it is. This simple rule can help keep you out of debt.',

    excerpt: 'How can a family save for vacation without drastically cutting their standard of living? Discover the art of finding balance between Ebenezer Scrooge-level frugality and thoughtful expense reduction that actually works.',
    content: 'Q: My family and I have been discussing how to save for our vacation. One thought was that we should reduce our expenses and put that money aside for our trip. I asked some of the people with whom I work for suggestions. Their ideas included bringing lunch to work instead of buying it, washing my own car instead of going to the car wash, and drinking regular coffee instead of going to the coffee shop. What other suggestions do you have to help us decrease our living expenses without infringing too much on our standard of living?\n\nA: The process of evaluating expenses and deciding where to spend your money is a good exercise. In fact it should be done on an annual basis because new expenses tend to creep in and eat up cash. Learning where to cut back without hurting your lifestyle is like finding money you never knew you had.\n\nThis newly found money can then be designated to other areas that are more important to you. Saving a little bit of money each day can grow into a great deal by the end of the year. Add it up: Simple math dictates that if you save just $5.00 each day, you\'ll have $1,825 by year\'s end.\n\nOf course, chopping firewood for your pot belly stove and eating a breakfast of dry bread and powdered milk is not for everyone. Ebenezer Scrooge taught us that quality of life is more important than large quantities of money in the bank. The trick is to find a balance between lavishness and austerity that works for you.\n\nProvided below are several pages of ideas for cutting back that participants in my financial seminars have submitted. Forms are also provided to help you list ideas and to calculate the amount you will save. Have fun!',

    title: 'From Red to Black: A Four-Step Plan to Eliminate Debt and Build Wealth',
    excerpt: 'A newly promoted head nurse with a substantial raise wants to break the debt cycle. Learn the four fundamental steps that lead from financial indebtedness to investment and wealth building.',
    content: 'Q: Recently, I became head nurse of a medical-surgical unit in a large teaching hospital. Along with the promotion and new responsibilities, I received a hefty raise. It seems I am always in debt and this may be a good time to make changes in my spending pattern. What are some steps I can take to get out of the red into the black financially?\n\nA: You are not alone. In fact, the average American family devotes about 25% of its spendable income to outstanding debts. There are several basic steps that when followed, will free you from financial indebtedness and allow you to invest in the future.\n\nThe first step is to live within your income. This involves establishing a realistic budget – the foundation for fiscal fitness. Without limits, it\'s difficult to control the flow of finances. You must then make spending decisions that allow you to honor your budget.\n\nThe second step is to establish a plan to pay off current debts. Prepare a list of your debtors and the amount owed to each. In separate columns, write down the total amount owed, the monthly payment for each one, and the length of time it will take to pay off each one. Now you have a realistic picture of your financial situation and the timeline necessary to take care of your obligations. If possible, take steps to pay off the principle in advance. This will reduce the amount of interest paid and free funds for use in lowering the principles of other debts.\n\nThe third step is to borrow from yourself. Instead of going to a bank or using your charge card to borrow more money, establish a savings account that equals at least three months of living expenses. With this as a base, you will have a source from which to draw money to pay for unexpected bills. Cash for a broken refrigerator, a ruined tire, or a new roof will be readily available. In essence, you become your own banker. Additional funds can be put aside for specific purchases, such as a new car, a lawn mower, a vacation, and holiday gifts. Include savings as part of your monthly budget now, even though you\'re still paying outstanding debts. This will establish a small reserve from which to draw for emergencies and a healthy pattern for the future.\n\nFinally, once you have established a cash reserve, money can be invested for the future. Retirement, a new home and college education are three common areas for which people invest.\n\nGetting out of debt and staying out of debt takes discipline and hard work. The person committed to following these four steps will experience the peace of mind and financial freedom provided by gaining financial control.',

    excerpt: '"I get paid on Friday and by Monday I\'m out of cash." Sound familiar? Discover a simple tracking method that can reduce impulse spending by 30% and reveal where your money really goes.',
    content: 'Q: During lunch the other day the subject of budgets came up. One of my colleagues said she isn\'t sure where all her money goes. She gets paid on Friday and by Monday she\'s out of cash. She\'s obviously spending more for "out of pocket" items than she realizes. What suggestions do you have to help her control this?\n\nA: The Case of the Missing Cash is not an uncommon caper. A cash flow record can reveal where your money was spent and help reduce cash flow. This record consists of a sheet of paper divided into three sections. On the left side is a column for writing the date of each cash purchase. The middle section is for indicating the items purchased, and the column on the right is for listing the amount. Use this form for every purchase made during a 60-day period. Out-of-pocket cash spent for a quick gallon of milk on the way home from work, a magazine at the newsstand, and lunch out can then be duly recorded in your budget.\n\nMost people are amazed at what they find. The amount of compulsive spending at fast food restaurants, clothing stores, or hardware centers can add up to significant dollars. With this information in hand, you can adjust your budget to reflect what is actually spent. Many people also find the exercise of writing down purchases makes them consider more carefully the necessity of each one. Typically, this results in a drop of 30% in cash purchases.\n\nThe cash flow record has helped many people gain control over their cash expenses. Some find it helpful as a permanent companion. Others pull it from their files for an annual 60-day check.',

    excerpt: 'Your employer offers a 403(b) plan with multiple fund options, but how do you choose? Learn the essential guidelines for selecting mutual funds that match your risk tolerance, time horizon, and retirement goals.',
    content: 'Q: My employer provides employees the option of investing in a 403(b) plan. This looks like a wonderful way to save for retirement since taxes are not taken out until after retirement. Most employees have decided to participate in this program, but we are not sure which fund to choose. What are some guidelines we can use in making this decision?\n\nA: The needs for each individual and family are different and depend upon their financial objectives. There are however some universal principles that are helpful:\n\n1. Secure a list of the mutual funds available through your employer that specialize in long-term growth and examine their track records. Such information is readily available online. Examine the rates of return during the past one, three, five and ten years. Past performance will, of course, not guarantee future performance. It will, however, provide a logical base of knowledge upon which to build.\n\n2. Consider carefully the risk factors involved with each fund. The greater the risk, the greater the potential for higher return. The amount of risk you are willing to take will depend upon your temperament and the amount of time over which you plan to invest. Some people are comfortable taking risks while others need the security of a sure thing. A fund that specializes in speculative stocks will fit the former. A fund that invests in secured bonds and treasury notes will be closer for the latter. Time is also part of the question. The person anticipating retirement in 30 years will have greater opportunities to recover from a poor return or loss than someone retiring in just five years.\n\n3. Diversification is an important consideration for any plan. It\'s smart to place your money in a variety of areas. This way, when one type of investment does poorly, others can compensate for the loss. There are several ways in which this can be done.\n\nYou may consider a single fund that invests in a variety of areas. These may include a combination of stocks from giant stable companies (Blue Chip), stocks that have opportunity for quick increase or decrease in value (speculative), company loans (bonds), loans from the US government (treasury notes), property (real estate), local or USA-based companies (domestic), companies outside the USA (foreign), and companies that specialize in a specific industry, such as healthcare, software, or utilities.\n\nYou may also choose to place money in several different funds that specialize in one of the areas listed above. This provides the diversification you desire as well as the expertise of several mutual management teams.\n\n4. The variety of fees charged are as diverse as the funds themselves. Some charge a fee when funds are purchased or sold, others have fees that decline the longer you keep your money invested with them, and others, called no-load funds, charge only a yearly maintenance fee. When such fees are compared their past and expected rate of return should be considered.\n\nDetailed information regarding the mutual companies in which you are interested can be found online. Read the information you secure carefully including the prospectus.',
